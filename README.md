## ✨ Features

- **🎯 Multi-Document Support**: Extracts from invoices, receipts, bills, statements, and order confirmations
- **🤖 AI-Powered Extraction**: Uses Claude Sonnet 4 for high-accuracy document analysis
- **📊 Confidence Scoring**: AI-generated confidence scores for each extracted field
- **✏️ Manual Review**: Edit any extracted field before export
- **📈 Cost Tracking**: Real-time tracking of API usage costs
- **📚 History**: Local storage of past extractions for easy reference
- **🎨 Modern UI**: Clean, responsive interface built with React and Tailwind CSS

## 🏗️ Architecture

Invoice Assistant uses a **multi-agent architecture** with specialized AI agents:

```
Upload → Extract Agent → Validation Agent → Score Agent → Review
         (Claude Sonnet)  (Business Rules)  (Claude Haiku)
```

### Agent Pipeline

1. **Extract Agent**: Analyzes document images and extracts structured data with document-type-specific logic
2. **Validation Agent**: Validates extracted data against business rules
3. **Score Agent**: Generates confidence scores and reasoning for each field

See [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md) for detailed design documentation.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ and npm
- Anthropic API key ([Get one here](https://console.anthropic.com/))

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/invoice-assistant.git
cd invoice-assistant

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Set up environment variables
# Create .env file and add your API key
echo "VITE_ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_api_key_here" > .env

# Start development server
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) in your browser.

## 🎯 Usage

1. **Upload Document**: Drag & drop or click to upload an invoice/receipt image
2. **Processing**: AI agents automatically extract and validate data
3. **Review**: Check extracted fields with confidence scores
4. **Edit**: Manually correct any fields if needed
5. **Export**: Save or export the structured data

## 🏛️ Design Decisions

### Hybrid Single-Agent Architecture
We use a single extraction agent with document-type-specific logic rather than multiple specialist agents. This provides:
- ✅ Lower latency (1 API call vs 2+)
- ✅ Simpler architecture for MVP
- ✅ Cost effectiveness
- ✅ Good accuracy (95%+ on quality documents)

See [ADR-001](docs/adr/0001-agent-architecture.md) for full analysis.

### Document-Type-Specific Rules
Instead of vendor-specific rules, we use universal document patterns:
- **Retail Receipts**: Order # → Receipt # → Transaction ID
- **Invoices**: Invoice # → Reference #
- **Bills**: Account # → Bill #

This scales across all vendors following standard formats. See [ADR-002](docs/adr/0002-document-type-rules.md) for rationale.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React 19, Vite, React Router, Tailwind CSS
- **AI/ML**: Claude Sonnet 4 (extraction), Claude Haiku 4 (scoring)
- **Storage**: LocalStorage (demo), migrate to database for production
- **APIs**: Anthropic SDK

## 📊 Performance

- **Latency**: ~2-4 seconds for full pipeline
- **Cost**: ~$0.01-0.03 per document
- **Accuracy**: ~95%+ on high-quality documents

## 🔒 Security & Deployment

### 🔐 Production Security

This app is production-ready with secure deployment to Netlify:

- ✅ **API Keys Protected**: Never exposed to the browser
- ✅ **Serverless Functions**: All API calls proxied through Netlify Functions
- ✅ **Cost Limits**: Automatic $1/day spending limit
- ✅ **Security Headers**: X-Frame-Options, CSP, and HTTPS enforced

### 🚀 Deploy to Netlify

[![Deploy to Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/img/deploy/button.svg)](https://app.netlify.com/start)

**Quick Deploy:**
1. Click the button above or connect your Git repository
2. Set `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` environment variable in Netlify
3. Deploy! Your app will be live with full security

📖 **[Full Deployment Guide](DEPLOYMENT.md)** - Complete setup instructions, cost management, and troubleshooting

### Local Development

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# For local testing with Netlify Functions
npm run dev:netlify

# Standard Vite dev server (no functions)
npm run dev
```

**Note**: You'll need a `.env` file with `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` for local development with functions. See [DEPLOYMENT.md](DEPLOYMENT.md) for details.

## 🚧 Roadmap
